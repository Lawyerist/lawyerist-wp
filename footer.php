		<p>Lawyerist is a blog about law practice. We help lawyers find the tools to improve their practices, we lead a conversation about law practice, and we have a strong online community of lawyers, the <a href="http://lab.lawyerist.com">Lawyerist LAB</a>.</p>

		<p>Lawyerist is written by a bunch of different people. Some are practicing lawyers, some are former practicing lawyers who are now doing other things related to law practice, and one or two aren't lawyers at all. Because lawyers don't know everything.
